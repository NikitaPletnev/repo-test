# Description

I rewrote most of the components almost from scratch completely because it looked terrible and extremely hard to read.

I wrote several tests: snapshot tests and tests for API.

I changed the structure of the project so that it could at least somehow be read and understand how does it work.

I rewrote  styles a and optimized for the adaptive a little. 

I decided not to spend a lot of time on it, because the styles in a good way need to be completely rewritten,
and for this I need the original layout.
